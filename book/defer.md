# Defer
Deferred statements are executed in first in last out order, they occur
during lexical scoping, the arguments for defer are evaluated at the defer,
and not when the defer itself is actually executed.

Defer is very handy for things like resource allocation:

```
mod std::io::file;

func main() -> int {
    file: ^File = File::open("shoppinglist.txt");
    // defer this for later
    defer file.close();
    
    // do some stuff with file here
    mut file_contents: str = "";
    while !file.eof() {
        file_contents = std::string::append(file_contents, file.read_line());
    }
    
    // file.close() is done here.
}
```
